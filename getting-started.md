# Getting Started in Data Science for College Students

## Introduction

This post is aimed towards students starting out college, who want a career in data science.
Here, I try to give my perspective, my advice and recommneded links to explore further.
Obviously, this post is biased by my path and my experience: I started out with undergrad
in Math and Computer Science, went on to do a PhD in Mathematics (Pure Math), then joined
industry as a data scientist.


## What is Data Science

The terms "Data Science" and "Data Scientist" are imprecise. It means a lot of things to a
lot of different people. There are multiple roles that can be termed under "Data Scientist"
and multiple paths to become one.

Broadly, data science signifies working with data:

* Collect, clean, store data and build data pipelines
* Extract meaningful/actionable insights from data, through statistical analysis and modeling
* Drive business decisions through data
* Build models (e.g., for prediction, classification, recommendation, search & ranking) and automate
* Serve models in production and monitor.


## Pillars of Data Science

Generally, a data scientist will have a mixture of the following competencies
(which can vary from one role to another, one person to another). Some of what
I listed below, are strongly needed for performing well in interviews at big
companies, even if day-to-day work may not require them.

* Domain/business knowledge
* Statistics and Probability (the basis of data analysis and machine learning)
* Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus (for understanding Machine Learning algorithms)
* Algorithms and Data Structures (for understanding complexities and efficient implementations)
* Programming (Python, R or Julia)
* Data Manipulation and Visualization (SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc...)
* Machine Learning (models for prediction, classification, recommendation, ranking...).


## My Advice for College Students

For students starting out, I'd advice...

* Read blogs about data science, to get familarity with different flavors, figure out what interest you.
* Learn the foundations: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Python, Algorithms & Data Structures (You won't get time to learn these stuff after college. Make most of this time).
* Learn the basics: Data Analysis, Visualization, Machine Learning, Statistics (This you will continue to learn throughout your career)
* Do some projects to get hands-on experience, work backward to learn what is needed (Important to build a portfolio of projects that you can showcase for interviews. Put them on Github). Also create blog posts about what you are learning and interesting projects.

To get started, I would advice to have three tracks:

1. Background competencies (difficult to acquire them once you are no longer a student)
  * Math (Linear Algebra and Calculus)
    - Try Strang's Linear Algebra course @MIT (see in recommended links) or read Strang's Linear Algebra book (has interesting applictinos)
    - Calculus, at least upto Multivariable Calculus (search on the web for content, if you are not learning it in college. Also see Terrence Shin's article mentioned below).
  * Algorithms and Data Structures (at least, stack, queue, heap, trees, search trees, graphs, graph algos, tree algos, string algos, recursion, divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithm, dynamic programming, backtracking). After this practice solving medium problems from LeetCode (after learning Python).
  * Probability and Statistics (See StatQuest in the section below)
  * Many interesting videos are available in the YouTube channel of 3Blue1Brown.

2. Active competencies:
  * Learn coding
    - Learn Python (checkout Python.org tutorial first) and setup Anaconda environment and familiarize yourself with jupyter notebook and ipython.
    - Should be comfortable with if..else, loops, functions, iterators, generators, strings, context, classes, lambdas, decorators etc.)
    - Learn the Data Science stack on Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn). One good resource is Python Data Science Handbook (see recommended links). There are many others.
    - Learn SQL
    - Be familiar with common toolings: conda, git, Github, Jupyter notebooks, ...
  * Machine Learning (There are many courses on the internet. I found Andrew Ng's course on Coursera the best starting point. Many reputed US university has websites of their courses: like MIT, Stanford, CMU, ...). Google is your friend!

3. Hands-on experience:
  * Try datasets available on the web (kaggle, analyticsvidhya, UCI, ...)
  * Try real-world problems with messy data
  * Try internships
  * Build protfolio: Blog about what you are learning and what interests you. Put your codes and Jupyter notebooks on Github.

Note that I highly recommend checking out Terrence Shin's 52 week curriculum for Data Science (link in section below).

You may also learn R and RStudio and it's stack (tidyverse, etc..) for data science and machine learning. In general, Python is more widely used
for general computing and machine learning, but R has excellent well-developed libraries for statistics and time series analysis. I learnt both Python
and R when I transitioned into Data Science. But, now I mostly use Python at work.

As you learn, simultaneously try to tackle some real problems with messy data. Write about them on your blog. Check in the codes and Jupyter Notebooks in Github.
Try to get internships.

## Conclusion

To each their own. The point of this guide is to make people starting out aware of quality free materials available online, and get them started
on their journey. After that find your own path. Go explore...
